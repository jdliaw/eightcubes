#### Please grade the version tagged v1.2

#### What was implemented?
    (1) Display a WebGL canvas without error
    (2) Display 8 unit cubes each with a different color, centered at +/-10 from the origin.
    (3) Draw each cube's outline in white
    (4) 'c' key cycles colors between the cubes
    (5) Cubes display in square aspect ratio
    (6) Up and down keys control position of camera along y-axis
    (7) Left and right keys control the heading of the camera azimuth
    (8) 'ijkm' keys move forward, left, right, and backward respectively relative to the camera's current heading. 'r' key resets the view to the start position
    (9) 'n' and 'w' keys narrow/widen the field of view
    (10) '+' key toggles the display of a crosshair in white

#### Extra Credit
    (1) Instance each of the cubes from the same geometry data
    (2) Implement the cube as a single triangle strip primitive
    (3) Continuously rotate and scale each of the cubes while the application is running.

<!-- Display eight (8) unit cubes using a symmetric perspective projection. Each of the eight cubes should be centered at (+/- 10, +/- 10, +/- 10) from the origin. Each of the eight cubes should be drawn with a different color. You can use any colors except black or white. All eight cubes should be visible from an initial camera position along the Z axis - 20 points. -->
